# Protocol Security Lab (Phase 4.5)

A focused repo for **break & fix** protocol-level security patterns:

- vulnerable examples
- exploit / reproduction steps
- mitigations (fixed versions)
- short writeups linking **invariant → failure → impact**

## How to navigate
- `vulnerabilities/` — intentionally broken contracts
- `exploits/` — scripts / steps to reproduce exploits
- `mitigations/` — fixed versions + notes
- `docs/` — methodology and checklist

## Rule
This repo is intentionally **separate** from the main interview portfolio.

The main portfolio links here from:
`smart-contract-architect-portfolio/bug-zoo/README.md`
