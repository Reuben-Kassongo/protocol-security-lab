# Cairo Security Playground (Phase 4.5)

A focused repo for **break & fix** security patterns in Cairo:
- vulnerable example
- exploit / reproduction
- mitigation (fixed version)
- short writeup linking invariant → failure → impact

## How to navigate
- `vulnerabilities/` — intentionally broken Cairo contracts
- `exploits/` — scripts / steps to reproduce
- `mitigations/` — fixed versions + notes
- `docs/` — methodology and checklist

## Rule
This repo is intentionally separate from the main interview portfolio.
The main portfolio links here from: `bug-zoo/README.md`.
