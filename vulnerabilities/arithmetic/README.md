# Arithmetic — Conservation Broken

Why this matters:
Arithmetic failures silently corrupt system truths, causing downstream components to rely on incorrect prices, balances, or solvency assumptions.

Invariant:
Math must preserve conservation and remain within defined bounds.

Failure:
Stale / Reorder — calculations use outdated, unchecked, or incorrectly rounded values.

Impact:
Prices drift, solvency checks fail, and economic guarantees collapse across the system.
